            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So then, deſtroye loue, and deſtroy a ſheepe of Chriſt: but his ſheepe cannot be deſtroyed; therefore their loue ſhall alway laſt. It cannot be loſt, it cannot be deſtroyed. This ſhall ſuffice for the ſixt motiue,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:185202:24"/> that ſhould moue vs to entertaine and practiſe this vertue <hi>loue,</hi> drawne from the conſideration of the excellencie thereof, and from the manifolde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which it doth affoord.</p>
                  <p>Seauenthly, if a man loue that, which he ought to loue, he is happie <note place="margin">Si quis amat quod amare iuuat, felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ardet: Gaudeat, &amp; Vento naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ille ſuo.

Therefore his loue is good, hee is happie in his loue, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue therein without repentance.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, true loue is an enemie to vice, and as it links many together, and makes them haue (as it were) one ſoule in many bodies, ſo it alſo doth oppoſe it ſelfe to thoſe things, which ingender <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:185202:24"/> but no craft: ſalues, but no ſores. It is as <hi>water</hi> to quench the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is as a <hi>South-wind</hi> to driue away all hard weather, to make vs leaue all hard, cruell, and vnconſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealing. It is as <hi>bellowes</hi> to blowe vp and increaſe courteſie, good-will, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie, modeſtie, and moderation. It is as a <hi>Caſtle,</hi> to beare out and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all aduerſe batterie, and to arme a man againſt all the boults and bullets of diſcord: and it is alſo an <hi>Engine</hi> to diſturbe and ouerthrowe the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks of debate, &amp; the muniments of malice: and as a <hi>Sword</hi> to cut off the head of hatred.

                  <p>Ninthly, he that loued his brother truely, that is, for the ſake of Chriſt, doth plainly ſhewe that his loue is greater vnto Chriſt. For he that loues the ſeruant for his Maſters ſake, doth much more loue the Maſter. For the rule is, that that thing, for which any thing doth exiſt, doth it ſelfe much more exiſt. Therefore if I loue my brother becauſe I loue Chriſt, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that my loue to Chriſt is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then my loue to him.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, we ought to loue our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, though we had no other reaſon to moue vs ſo to do, but that we know that Chriſt doth loue them as well as vs, and that the Diuel doth hate them, as he doth our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we are commaunded to do all things in loue; therefore we muſt loue, and haue loue. A Goldſmith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not trie his gold by a touchſtone, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he haue a touchſtone. A Founder

                  </p>
                  <p>A. I anſwer: he that loueth Chriſt, as Chriſt hath taught him, may know
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:185202:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> for certen that Chriſt loueth him. And a man ſhall neuer truly loue Chriſt, till he be perſuaded, in ſome meaſure, that Chriſt doth loue him. We loue him, becauſe he loued vs. Secondly, he that is carefull to ſerue and honour him, may aſſure himſelfe that he is beloued of him. For Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, that both hee and his Father, do loue thoſe <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 21.</note> that keep his commandements. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be thou ſure that thou doeſt obey him, and then thou mayeſt aſſure thy ſelfe of his loue. Thirdly, a man may know that Chriſt loued him, of he find in him ſelfe the fruites of the Spirit, which are found in none, but in thoſe whom Chriſt doth loue. Theſe fruits are peace of conſcience, ioy, long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> gentlenes, goodnes, meeknes, temperancy, and brotherly loue. And albeit the Reprobate may haue theſe fruits in ſhew, yet he hath them not indeede, as the Godly haue. All is not the Sun, which ſhineth: neither is all that Gold, which gliſters. For if they ſhould be tryed by the touchſtone of the word, it would appeare that their

                        </gap>yle.</hi> But yet that wee may attaine to the perfect vnderſtanding of theſe words, two queſtions had need to be anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it may be dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, how Chriſt can be ſaide to haue waſhed vs from our ſins, ſeeing that ſin remaineth in vs vnto death.</p>
                  <p>For our ſatisfaction herein, we muſt know, that Chriſt is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>de to waſh our ſinnes away in his blood, becauſe hee hath therby procured their pardon ſo, as that they ſhall neuer be imputed to vs vnto condemnation. For ſin is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed away two waies. Firſt, when God
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:185202:39"/> forgiues it, and layeth it not to our charge; and this he doth in the iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſinner. Secondly, when he mortifieth it, and repaireth his ruinated image within vs; and this is called the waſhing of ſanctification.</p>
                  <p>Now the waſhing of ſanctification is properly vnderſtood in the text.</p>
                  <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, it may be demanded wherin the abſolution &amp; waſhing away of ſin in Iuſtification by the blood of Chriſt differeth from the ablution &amp; purging of it in ſanctification by the water and fire of the Holy Ghoſt, Or, wherin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of ſinnes differs from regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and wherein they iump.</p>
                  <p>They agree in three reſpects. Firſt in their efficient cauſe. For God is the author of both, through the merit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they haue one commune inſtrumentall cauſe, which is faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they haue one generall end: to wit, the glory of God, and the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of our ſoules. But yet they differ very much in other reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in their forme or nature. For
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:185202:39"/> remiſsion of ſins is an action of God, wherby he doth couer our ſins in the blood of Chriſt, not imputing them to vs, but to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a work of God, wherby through the effectuall operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Spirit, he doth alter and change the heart, mortifying the fleſh, illuminating the mind, refining the affections, and ſanctifying all the parts of the body, and all the powers of the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they differ in their ſubiect. For the minde, the will, and the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are the ſubiects of ſanctification, but not of the remiſsion of ſins. The obedience of Chriſt is imputed to vs, and is not inhoerent in vs, as are the graces of regeneration, Remiſsion of ſinne is an action of God out of a man: but mortification is within a man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, their obiect is diuerſe. For the law is the obiect of ſanctification: but remiſsion of ſinne reſpecteth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they differ in their effects. For remiſſion of ſins makes vs to be accounted no ſinner: but ſo doth not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:185202:40"/> regeneration. The ablu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And he is that <hi>Son,</hi> which a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <note place="margin">Iſ. 7. 14.</note> ſhould conceiue and bring foorth. He is ſayd to be borne, and circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to hunger, thirſt, die, and riſe again: all which do ſufficiently proue the truth of his humanity. Now it was requiſite that Chriſt ſhould be a man. Firſt that the prophecies, that went long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his humane nature, might be truly fulfilled. Secondly, the iuſtice of God required, that that nature ſhould be puniſhed, which had offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſeemed moſt equall in Gods eye, that ſatiſfaction for the ſinne of man ſhould be made, in the nature of man. Fourthly, that he might be a mercifull <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 17.</note> high Prieſt, able to be touched with the feeling of our infirmities. Laſtly, that he might be able to ſuffer and die for vs. For the God head cannot poſsibly ſuffer; beeing an impaſsible, pure, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, <note place="margin">1.

Fourthly, he was to be a preacher of holines, &amp; a taxer of iniquity; therfore it was fitteſt that he ſhould be holy, leſt his practiſe ſhould croſſe his preaching, and ſo marre his Miniſterie.

                  <p>The vſe of this doctrine is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. Firſt, we ſee a plaine difference <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt teacheth vs to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:185202:71"/> pray for our <hi>bread,</hi> and for the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our ſinnes. Now ſhall we, that cannot merit a morſel of bread, think that we can ſatiſfie the <hi>infinite</hi> iuſtice of God for any ſinne, or for the ſmalleſt puniſhment of the ſmalleſt ſinne? Are we, that are leſſe then the leaſt of all Gods mercies, able to merit any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of him, that is Iuſtice itſelfe, though it be but freedome from the meaneſt miſery? And what need we to begge pardon vpon the knees of our ſoules, what need we to trouble the Lord with our ſuites, if we can ſatiſfie his iuſtice by our ſelues? To aſke forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to make ſatiſfaction in our owne perſons by our ſelues, can not ſtand together. Thirdly, the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt is perfect and abſolute, and to ſay the contrary, is intollerable blaſphemy. But perſonall ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe derogate from the perfection of his ſatisfaction, and the invaluable value of his ſacrifice, by which Gods iuſtice is fully ſatisfied, and his wrath appeaſed.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if Chriſt haue ſatisfied for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:185202:71"/> the greater, for the greateſt of all, what reaſon haue we to think, that he meant to leaue the ſmaller to bee ſatisfied for of vs, whome hee knew to be vnfit, vnfurniſht, weake, and vnworthy to attempt ſo great a work, much more to effect it, howſoeuer we might perhaps affect it? <hi>And if without him we can doe nothing,</hi> as hee himſelfe doth tell vs, <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 5.</note> vndoubtedly, without him wee can make no ſatisfaction for our ſinnes to God. And it hath beene already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that hee doth not inable vs to ſatisfie, or make vs merit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee muſt aſcribe the remisſion of ſinnes, and of their temporall and eternall punniſhments to the merit of Chriſts bloud, and to the ineſtimable price of his death. And ſo much for this ſixt doctrine.</p>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:185202:88"/> of a ſtrong faith, and for the remonſtrance of their loue of Chriſt. On the contrarie, the bloud of Chriſt is his bloud, who is eſſentially God, and it is alſo the ranſome of our ſins.

And by this we ſee that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring his benefits he is far from the faſhion of the world. Many men do neuer ſhew any tokens of loue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue offended them or reuoulted from them: but vſually they ſeeke to be reuenged of them, either openly or vnder-hand. But Chriſt hath caried no ſuch ſpleene to vs, but hath highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured vs, who haue iniuſtly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him, and many wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, wee are all taught to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence one another. Let not the rich con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the poore: let not the young deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe the olde: let not the noble diſdaine the ſimple: let not the learned politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian vilipend the man of meaner vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.

He, that aduanced one, hath aduaunced the reſt; the poore as well as the rich, the meane man, as well as the mighty Monarch.</p>
                  <p>And though here in this world God himſelfe hath made vs ſubiects, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our obedience to his Lieutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts here on earth, whom to diſobey, is to rebell againſt God himſelfe, yet when we come to take poſſeſsion of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly kingdome, in the day of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Coronation, all outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhalbe layde downe: and if in

                  <p>Fourthly, ſeeing Chriſt doth make thoſe kings and prieſts, whom hee wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth in his bloud, it ſhould ſtirre vs vp to labour by all meanes to be partakers of it. As wee deſire this true nobilitie, &amp; to poſſeſſe this great aduancement, ſo let vs be carefull of the other, that in all aſſurance wee may enioy it. For theſe benefites are inſeparable.

Now as the Church our mother is, ſo are all thoſe that are her faithfull &amp; true children, according as God hath meaſured out his grace vnto vs. For Chriſt hath made vs all kings &amp; prieſts, yea and prophets alſo, and hath ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the temple of our heartes with the manifolde graces of his Spirit. Our caſe in this world is not vnlike the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the Tabernacle, which were courſe without, but finely wrought within. Therefore they, which deeme men forſaken of God, becauſe the world doth frowne vppon them, are

                  <p>Fourthly, kings of this world (if they ſhould prooue worldly minded, as the moſt are, and vſe to bee,) may become Tyrants, and irreconciliable enemies one vnto another, labouring with all their powers to deturbe and ouer throw each other: But ſo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:185202:115"/> For he ſo ruleth them by his Spirit, and with the Scepter of his word, that they ſhall neuer clime to that height of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kendeſſe, as of deſpite and purpoſe to ſeeke the deſtruction of one anothers ſoule, and to depriue them of their crownes.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, earthly kings may be plagued of God to the loſſe of their ſoules, and therfore <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Tophet</hi> (or hell) <note place="margin">Iſ. 30. 33.</note>

                  <p>Laſtly, earthly Kings come to their kingdomes, either by conqueſt, or by their bloud, or elſe by voyces, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:185202:116"/> merits of Ieſus Chriſt, who by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering death, and fulfilling the lawe for vs, hath redeemed vs from hell, and procured heauen, and this our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now as concerning our <hi>Prieſt-hood,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> who tells vs that wee are an <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note>

                     <note place="margin">Rom 12. 1.</note> and we offer vp our ſelues aliue. Fiftly, they were Prieſts for others: but we are Prieſts for no men proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they were.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, their Altar was material and earthly: but ours is aliue, and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: to wit, Chriſt Ieſus. Seuenthly, their prieſthood had an end, but ours is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. Eightly, theirs went from one to another by ſucceſſion, but ſo doth not ours. Ninthly, amongſt them ſome were ſeperiours: but there is no ſuch diuerſitie of degrees among vs beeing ſimply conſidered as we are Prieſtes. Indeed there is diuerſity of graces, and there ſhal be inequality of glory, thogh there ſhalbe no want, but fulneſſe in all. Tenthly, many of them were wicked, and ſome profeſſed enemies of Chriſt &amp; his religion: But they which Chriſt hath made Prieſts, are <hi>holy, choſen, and a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Pet. z. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>people ſet at liberty,</hi> &amp; ſuch as ſhal not dy, but liue. Laſtly, they were all of them males of one nation, and of one kinred of that nation, and they to be without
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:185202:117"/> any bodily defect or blemiſh: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt <note place="margin">Eeuit. 21. 18</note> vs there are both men &amp; women, of all tribes &amp; nations, and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them want not outward defects, either by nature or by accident, yet Chriſt reſpecteth not the outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of any man in working for vs this honour.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning Chriſt and his Prieſthood; he was the Subſtance or Truth of all thoſe Sacrifices and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes: at his death their date went out, whereas contrariwiſe our Prieſt-hood then began; So that wee are but vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls to that great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igh Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee is an externall Prieſt of the New Teſtament, but we are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Prieſts, and not outward.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, his principall ſacrifice was himſelfe: but we haue other ſacrifices <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 11.</note> to offer beſides our ſelues, &amp; our ſelues no way acceptable in our ſelues, but in him. Fourthly, his ſacrifice was of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, to ſatiſfie the iuſtice of God for vs; But ours is of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to God: not ſatiſfactory, but decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory: to ſhew our ſelues mindfull of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:185202:117"/> that expiatory ſacrifice which Chriſt offered, and to teſtifie our loue vnto him for it, and how gratefully we do receiue it.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, his was offered once for all, but ours muſt be offered daily vpon all occaſions. Sixtly, he as Preiſt, was God and Man: but we are meere men, ſimple and ſilly creatures.</p>
                  <p>Seauenthly, his Altar was his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, but our Altar is his Godhead and Manhead, alſo vnited in one perſon.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, his Sacrifice was voluntary; hee did not owe it to vs: but ours are debts, which are for many cauſes to be performed duely of vs.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, if wee had not ſinned, his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice had bene ſpared: but ſome of ours ſhould haue bin performed of vs, though we had not ſinned.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, the goodneſſe of his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice came from himſelfe: but if ours haue any goodneſſe, ſo farre ſorth as they be good, it is from his holy Spirit, which worketh in vs.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Chriſts ſacrifice was perfect of it ſelfe, being his, who is perfect
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:185202:118"/> man, and perfect God: but ours are in this life maymed and imperfect: and their imperfection is couered by the perfection of his. And thus we ſee the glorious eſtate of all the faythfull, that euen as Chriſt their Head is a king and Prieſt, ſo are all they kings and prieſts alſo, yea a kingdome of prieſts, a regall and holy prieſthood; although it be with great difference. For they receiue this honour by him, and not he through them. He is a king by nature, but they by grace. Hee is an abſolute Prince ouer all creatures whatſoeuer, and ouer the very conſcience: but ſo are not they. He is now in the full poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his kingdome: ſo are not we: but we wayt in our mortall bodies of this earthly thraldome, for the hope of that mortall and regall liberty of the ſonnes of God in the heauens.</p>

                  <p>HAuing now declared the nature of this benefit, it remaineth for me to gather the Inſtructions: which may from hence be reaped. And theſe are of two ſorts. Of the firſt kind are they that ariſe from the conſideration of theſe two ſtates together: and they are in number foure.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we are taught to take heed of all ſtaine of ſinne. For though it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable in all, yet in thoſe ſpeciallie <note place="margin">Omne ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi vitium, tanto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectius in ſe crimen habet, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tò maior, qui peccat, habetur, Iuuen.

And the falls of Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are moſt obſerued and ſooneſt eſpied. The bare practiſe of a King, is as a precept to the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:185202:119"/> people: and wicked prieſts are by their very examples occaſions of much euill.</p>
                  <p>And if wee, that would perſwade the world by our outward profeſsion that wee are as kings and prieſts vnto God, ſhall break forth into open enormities, we ſhall not onely diſgrace our calling, but we ſhall cauſe many other to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fall by our example. Men are by nature like <hi>Towe:</hi> and leaude enſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are as <hi>Matches</hi> to ſet them on fire, and to make them rage in ſinning like <hi>wild-fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſeeing we are ſo highly graced by Chriſt, we ſhould arme our ſelues with comfort againſt all our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and againſt the bitternes of all afflictions. What though man diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thee, yet Chriſt doth honour thee? What if thou beeſt poore, yet thou ſhalt be rich, yea thou art rich; For (as the Apoſtle ſheweth) <hi>all things are</hi>

                     <hi>yours. Whether it be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death: whether they be things preſent, or things to come, euen all are yours.</hi> And ſhall we thinke that he, which hath thus highly
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:185202:119"/> promoted vs, will ſuffer vs to want thoſe things, which in his wiſedome he knoweth to be fit for vs? There is no reaſon for vs thus to thinke. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith; <hi>Feare the Lord: for nothing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſ. 34. 9. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>is wanting to them, that feare him. The Lions do lacke, &amp; ſuffer hunger, but they, which ſeeke the Lord, ſhall want nothing that is good.</hi> And he ſaith in his owne experience; <hi>I haue beene young and now</hi>

                     <hi>am old: yet I neuer ſaw the righteous for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor his ſeed begging bread. For the Lord forſaketh not his Saints</hi> (his kings and prieſts) <hi>they ſhalbe preſerued for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</hi> Yea but the world doth diſgrace and deride thee. It is no maruell. For ſhe did as much for Chriſt before thee. And ſhall the ſeruant thinke to fare better then his maiſter?

                     </gap>hee? And though the world repute baſely of thee, yet are thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of God a king, and prieſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen one of his Annointed. For all, that Chriſt hath thus dignified are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:185202:120"/> with the <hi>oyle of gladneſſe,</hi> the <note place="margin">Pſ. 45. 7.</note> oyle of grace.

                  <p>Thirdly, ſeeing our calling is ſo great, &amp; our place ſo high, it behoueth vs to be carefull of our companions. It beſeemes not the maieſtie of a king, nor the grauitie of a prieſt, to conuerſe with eueryrif-raffe perſon.

Is it ſeemely for a kings ſonne, to be a companion with rebells, traytors, and thoſe, which are enemies to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Are not we the ſonnes of God, the king of kings, nay are we not kings our ſelues?

                  <argument>
                     <p>Fiue inſtructions are gathered out of the conſideration of our princehood.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THoſe of the ſecond ſort, be ſuch as ariſe out of the conſideration of theſe two titles or callings, apart by themſelues, one of them beeing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly conſidered by it ſelfe from the other. And for the former firſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, forſomuch as wee are <hi>kings,</hi> we ought to acquainte our ſelues with our owne Kingdomes, and not to be good Stateſ-men abroad, and <hi>(foris ſapere)</hi> to be wiſe in other mens affayres, and to be ignorant of, and inconſiderate, or rechleſſe of our owne. It is not the leaſt <note place="margin">Principis eſt virtus maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, noſſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os, Martiall.</note> praiſe of a Prince to know his ſubiects. And for as much as the kingdome of our heartes hath no ſmall number of traytors and enemies to our Crowne, lurcking in ſecret corners, readie like Wolues at the leaſt aduantage to work a miſchiefe, to make an vprore, or an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen rebellion in vs: it is requiſite that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:185202:123"/> wee labour to knowe that faithfull <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathans,</hi> and what faithleſſe <hi>Iudaſſes,</hi> we haue within vs; For as ther is no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdome, but hath ſome enemies to it: euen ſo there is no ſpirituall king a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, which hath not enemies to his crowne and kingdome. Yea wee haue within our own courts many, that would (if they could) pull the crowne from our heads, and thruſt vs from our thrones.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſeeing wee are <hi>Kings,</hi> wee ought to keepe ccontinuall watch and ward, contending by all good means to defend our ſelues and ſtates. For wiſe kings haue their guardes, and are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to preuent all miſchiefes that may befall them. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> faith (chap. 7.) that after the walles of the Citie were built, he appointed wardes: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God hath giuen vs a kingdome, &amp; hath in part repaired the ruines of his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in vs, let vs ward, that wee be not depriued of our crowne, and fruſtrated of our hopes: and that not without our weapons to defend our ſelues, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our enemies, which are for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:185202:123"/> many, and for power mighty. And that wee may proue good watch-men, and not be ſurprized before wee be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, let vs firſt commend our ſelues and eſtates vnto God. For <hi>except the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſ. 127. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord doe keepe the Citie, the keeper wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth but in vaine.</hi> Vnleſſe the Lord doe watche for vs: vnleſſe the Lord do protect vs with the ſhield of his grace, &amp; couer vs with the wings of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, we lye expoſed to our enemies, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be taken of them. Secondly, let vs haue a watch-full eye to the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> abroade, to the tentations of the Diuell, &amp; the allurements of the world. For Satan is ſubtill. When hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not oppreſſe vs with violence like a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> then hee begins to play the <hi>Fox,</hi> transforming himſelfe into an <hi>Angell</hi> of light, and ſo ſeeking (like a <hi>Wolfe</hi> in a <hi>ſheepes</hi> skin,) to ſeduce and kill vs. And what are the ſweet intiſements of the world, but pleaſant enchantments to be witch vs, and as the Fiſhermans <hi>bayte,</hi> which hath an hooke incloſed in it to catch the fiſh by the iawes? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, look narrowly to the <hi>Cananite</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:185202:124"/> doore, that is, to the corruption of thine heart, that cruell <hi>Abimelech,</hi> that falſe-hearted <hi>Delilah,</hi> and ambitious <hi>Abſalom,</hi> which beeing but a bramble, would faine be king, and ouertop the vine of Gods graces in vs, ſeeking by fraude and force to depoſe vs from our kingdomes. Remember the counſell of the holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hoſt, who ſaith; <hi>keep thine</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 4. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>heart with all diligence: for thereout com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth life.</hi> To this ende doe theſe three things. Firſt, let Gods word dwell plenteouſly in thee, and meditate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good things: turne thine eyes from beholding vanities, and inure thy feet to right pathes. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith; <hi>I kept thy</hi>

                     <hi>word in mine heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> Secondly, haue warrant from the word of God for all thy thoughts and actions, and let it be the key to locke vp &amp; to open the doore of thy lips. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: <hi>eſtabliſh thy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 20. 18.</note>

                     <note place="margin">Pſ. 119, 24.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, be ſure to vſe all thoſe things, which may cheriſh the ſpirit,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:185202:124"/> and weaken the fleſh. Hear the word: be frequent in prayer: foſter good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: meditate of the death of Chriſt: apply the vertue of his reſurrection vnto thee by thy faith: <hi>and greeue not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>the holy Spirit of God by whom ye are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto the day of redemption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſeeing we are kings, we ought to be valorous, conſtant, and couragious. An effeminate and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſpoſition is a diſgrace to a Prince. But it is the royaltie and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt commendation of a king to be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall and valiant, and to beare all things, that may betide him, with a <note place="margin">Regiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hoc ipſum reor, aduerſa ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere, Sen.</note> magnanimious, noble, and vndaunted ſpirit. Kings ought to be <hi>Eagles</hi> for their wiſdome: <hi>Doues</hi> for their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, but yet withall, <hi>Lions</hi> for their fortitude: and ſo ſhould we be alſo, that are things in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, let vs beware of illiberall and baſe mindes, that wee ſolder not our affections to the earth.</p>
                  <p>An abiect &amp; vaſſall-like minded king is a very skoffe among men, and a very Monſter in nature. It would amaze
